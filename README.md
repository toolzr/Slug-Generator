# Slug Generator

The Slug Generator is an open-source, JavaScript-based tool that creates SEO-friendly URL slugs. It's designed to be simple and efficient, making it an ideal choice for bloggers, content creators, and web developers who aim to improve their website's search engine rankings through better URL structure.

## Features

- **SEO-Friendly Slugs**: Generates clean, readable slugs that are optimized for search engines.
- **Customizable Separators**: Offers the choice between dashes (-) and underscores (_) as word separators.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to use, allowing for quick conversion of titles and phrases into slugs.

## How It Works

The Slug Generator converts any given text into a slug, using the specified separator. It ensures the slug is lowercase, trimmed, spaces are replaced with the chosen separator, all non-word characters are removed, and multiple separators are reduced to a single instance.

## Usage

To use the Slug Generator, simply input your text and choose your preferred separator. The tool will then provide a slug that can be used in URLs to make them more readable and SEO-friendly.
